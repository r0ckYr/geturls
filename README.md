# geturls
geturls.py fetches known URLs from AlienVault, Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, and Virustotal for any given domain. Inspired by Tomnomnom's waybackurls and Corben's getallurls (gau).

It fetches urls form all four sources, so you don't need to run both tools.

**Usage:**
```
python3 geturls.py <url>
```

**Installation**
```
git clone https://github.com/r0ckYr/geturls.git
cd geturls
chmod +x geturls.py
```

**Todo**
1. Add user options
2. Improve error handling
